Hi there, I'm Damian! 👋

Data Engineer & Process Automation Enthusiast

I bridge the gap between Business Logic and Hard Tech. Currently optimizing industrial processes at Siemens, and building open-source tools for the AI community after hours.

My focus is on Efficiency, Data Quality, and Local-First AI infrastructure.

🚀 Featured Project: EntropyGuard

Stop feeding your RAG pipelines with garbage.

I engineered an open-source ETL engine to solve the problem of "Dirty Data" in Large Language Models.

The Problem: Semantic duplicates and noise cause LLM hallucinations and bloat Vector DB costs.

The Solution: A privacy-first, local engine that deduplicates data by meaning (vectors), not just text.

Performance: Reduced a 10k dataset to 50 unique signals in <2 mins on a laptop CPU.
